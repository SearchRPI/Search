Now:
Generate Matching Set of Documents for a Search Query
-> Retreive "postlists" (list of documents retrieved from index, that are relevant for a specific term)
-> Merge "postlists"
-> Score Documents
-> Return top scorers
Build Test Suite

Soon:
Query Parsing (Query Trees)
Query Optimization
Snippets
Latency Evaluation / Logging

Later:
Filters
Query Expansion
Caching

A lot later:
Field Weighting
Logical Operators (AND, OR, NOT, etc.)

Possibly in the future:
Sharding / Distributed System
Implement Inverted Index from scratch instead of using LMDB (A lot of work, but will improve scalability)
